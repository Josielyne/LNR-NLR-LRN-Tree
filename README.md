# LNR-NLR-LRN-Tree
Creates a binary tree with user input and shows different traversals.
The nodes for the tree are created using a class. There are 6 functions within this class: One for inserting nodes, which uses recursive function calls 
to find the correct location of a new node within the tree, another for deleting a node, one for finding the node with the lowest value in the tree or subtree,
and three for the different types of traversals (LNR, NLR, and LRN). The menu is operated through a switch, which has 6 cases and a default. The display of the
tree is done using gotoxy.
